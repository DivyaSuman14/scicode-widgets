Note on usage
-------------

So far scicode-widget has been developed by prototyping without much concern about the code quality. This resulted in faster development time but in cost of readability and maintanability of the code. Since we finished now the prototype phase and have converged on a set of functionalities we are satisfied with, we are in the process of refactoring the resulting code in the `main branch <https://github.com/osscar-org/scicode-widgets/tree/main>`_. While we are refactoring the code we recommend the usage of this branch which is also used in the course "Introduction to Atomistic Modeling" (see `_github repo <https://github.com/ceriottm/iam-notebooks>`_) till all features have been implemented in the refactor, but don't exepect stable or readable code at this stage.
